# 🛠 Issues

### 📝 Creating new issues

🎉 Any issue, whether it be bugs, feature requests, or general feedback is welcome!

If you would like to make a suggestion, please create an issue with the following information included:

- Description of the 'problem'
- Brief justification of a solution

Our team is using JIRA to track our tickets. However, we will periodically check for new issues created here!
If you are interested in working on an issue, please let us know and we'll create/update the board for you!

### ⚠ Bug reporting

Bugs can be reported by anyone at anytime. Check `bugs` label for duplicate reports. Bug reports should contain:

- a **description** of the bug (_what_ happened)
- detailed **steps** to reproduce the bug (_when_ the bug happened)
- a **screen shot** of the bug (if possible)
- browser, OS, version # of Node (this can help us understand _why_ the bug occurred)
- any other **notes** (e.g. if the bug only occurs in certain situations)

If you find an existing bug report that is missing information (such as if a bug can be reproduced in other ways), feel free to add details.

# 🔀 Pull requests

## 🌿 Branch naming

Branches should be named based on the corresponding JIRA story number and the associated changes.

## 💬 Commit Messages

When writing a commit message, avoid messages like `fix` or`wip` - for example, write `Fix x` or `Scaffold y`.
